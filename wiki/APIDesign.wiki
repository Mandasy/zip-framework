The Zip framework doesn't work yet, but ideally reading files from zip archives would be accomplished with only a few lines of code:

{{{
#import <stdio.h>
#import <Zip/ZipArchive.h>

ZipArchive *zip = [[ZipArchive alloc] initWithFile:@"..."];
if (!zip) {
    NSLog(@"File could not be opened");
}

FILE *fp = [zip entryNamed:@"README.txt"]; // open stream to file README.txt in archive
if (!fp) {
    NSLog(@"Not a file or not available in the archive");
}

NSArray *allEntries = [zip entries];
// for example: [@"README", @"COPYING", @"src/", @"src/main.c"]

[zip release];

// Autoreleased version
ZipArchive *autoreleasedZip = [ZipArchive archiveWithFile:@"..."];
}}}

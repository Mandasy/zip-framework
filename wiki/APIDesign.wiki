The Zip framework doesn't work yet, but ideally reading files from zip archives would be accomplished with only a few lines of code:

{{{
#import <stdio.h>
#import <Zip/ZipArchive.h>

ZipArchive *zip = [[ZipArchive alloc] initWithFile:@"..."];
FILE *fp = [zip entryForName:@"README.txt"]; // open stream to file README.txt in archive
if (!fp) {
    printf("File does not exist in archive");
}
}}}

Please enter code examples on how you would want to use this framework in the comments below.
